- Decaf.

Okay, everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.900
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe...

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.361
...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:11.654
- Sure!
- Hey.

00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:13.739

[SIGHS]

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.125
So you wanna tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:32.341
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.927
I was in this room
with all the presents...

00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:36.929
...and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

00:00:37.138 --> 00:00:40.557
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.559
When all of a sudden...
Sweet 'N Low?

00:00:42.727 --> 00:00:44.853
- I realized...

00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:48.941
...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.152
Then I got really freaked out,
and that's when it hit me:

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.114
How much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head.

00:00:55.532 --> 00:00:58.784
You know, I mean, I always knew
he looked familiar, but...

00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:04.290
Anyway, I just had to get out of there,
and I started wondering:

00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:08.127
"Why am I doing this?"
And "Who am I doing this for?"

00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:12.673
Anyway, I just didn't know where to go,
and I know you and I have drifted apart...

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:15.718
...but you're the only person
I know in the city.

00:01:15.927 --> 00:01:17.594
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:20.889
Oh, I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

the big pipe organ...

00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:40.200
...and she's really not
happy about it.

00:01:41.453 --> 00:01:44.496
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.

00:01:44.664 --> 00:01:46.332
I'm sorry.

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:49.376
I just don't love him.

00:01:49.836 --> 00:01:52.504
Well, it matters to me.

CHANDLER:
She should not be wearing those pants.

00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:00.554

Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.985
It's like all of my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!

00:02:15.153 --> 00:02:17.237
You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!"

00:02:17.447 --> 00:02:20.616
Then today I stopped and said,
"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

What if I wanna be a purse?
You know?

00:02:24.162 --> 00:02:25.954
Or a hat?"

00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:29.416
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I am a hat.

00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:31.794
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:35.381
You can see where he'd have trouble.

00:02:38.635 --> 00:02:40.511
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

I guess we've established

00:02:51.898 --> 00:02:54.691
Well, maybe that's my decision.

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:57.528
Well, maybe I don't need your money.
